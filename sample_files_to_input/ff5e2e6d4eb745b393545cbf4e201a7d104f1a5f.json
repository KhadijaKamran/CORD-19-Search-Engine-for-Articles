Unlike other animal-to-human coronavirus diseases, this virus shows potential to spread more rapidly in certain areas or countries within the short period of a few weeks. A low incidence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been reported from countries with a high incidence of malarial infections. The author investigates whether the rapid spread of COVID-19 is related to the incidence of malaria cases in countries affected by COVID-19. The study utilized publicly available data on COVID-19 cases by countries reporting [2] . For each country affected by COVID-19, the incidence of malaria cases per 1000 population at risk in 2015 has been retrieved [3] .",

The model shows that as the malarial incidence rate (per 1000 population at risk) increased by 1, the COVID-19 incidence rate tends to decrease by 8.82%. A ROC curve analysis (Fig. 3) indicated that the incidence of COVID-19 was a good classifier (AUC = 0.8115) for countries that were malaria free or recorded limited malarial infections (5 or less per 1000 population at risk).",

For instance, in China (81,397 COVID-19 cases), Italy (59,138 COVID-19 cases), US (32,057 COVID-19 cases), Spain (28,603 COVID-19 cases), and Germany (23,974 COVID-19 cases). China reported limited transmission of malaria in 2015 (< 0.01 per 1000 population at risk). No malaria cases were reported in Italy, US, Spain, and Germany in 2015.On the other hand, world regions affected by malaria reported fewer or no cases of COVID-19(Fig. 2). The countries most affected by ma-laria were Burkina Faso (389.2 per 1000 population at risk), Nigeria (380.8 per 1000 population at risk), Guinea (367.8 per 1000 population at risk), and Niger (356.5 per 1000 population at risk). Burkina Faso reported 75 cases of COVID-19 and Nigeria reported 27 cases of COVID-19. Guinea and Niger each reported only 2 cases of COVID-19. One possible explanation of the limited spread of COVID-19 on countries affected by malaria is the wide use of anti-malarial drugs. This is in line with a study published in 2005 reporting that chloroquine tends to be an effective antiviral agent pre-and post-infection of SARS-CoV-1 [4]. It is possible that different viral strains of COVID-19 are currently circulating in Africa as the infection and death rates vary greatly by country. Despite the strong trade and travel flows links between China and African countries, limited community outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported in certain countries in Africa. It is also possible that limited international travels to other affected continents and environ-As of March 22, 2020, incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and malarial infections.
